    <h2>Why is this app better than WieBetaaltWat?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We support partial settlements between a subset of group participants.</li>
        <li>
            We do not push a payment system for settling.
            Just pay the others using your own familiar banking app, or with cash.
        </li>
{#        <li>This website does not require JavaScript to function (but it does make it better).</li>#}
