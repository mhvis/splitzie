                <summary><strong>How to enter a starting balance?</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    A way to enter a starting balance is to create a payment
                    with amount 0 and type income.
                    Then enter the starting balances in the division fields,
                    with negative balances as a negative value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Entering a payment in this way will modify the balances exactly
                    as inputted in the division fields.

                <summary><strong>What can you use custom repayments for?</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    The repayment form on the Settle page lets you enter arbitrary repayments.
                    For example, if you owe 2 euros to Bob and 3 euros to Alice,
                    instead of repaying both of them, you could also give 5
                    euros to Bob and ask him to pay the remainder forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the 5 euros repayment into the form, and the balances will change
                    so that Bob now owes 3 euros to Alice.
                </p>

                <summary><strong>How are division amounts rounded?</strong></summary>
                <p>
                    When a payment is divided, the division amounts may need to be rounded.
                    This means that some participants will get assigned an amount that is one cent
                    higher than other participants, to make sure that the sum of all divisions
                    is exactly equal to the total expense amount.
                    The participants who pay this extra cent are chosen randomly.
                    The difference is always at most one cent.
                </p>

                    For nerds: you can view the division script in the page source code (/static/splitzie.js).

            <p>
                This app is a hobby project, created because I was annoyed that the
                widely used Dutch apps WieBetaaltWat and Groepie do not allow for
                partial settlements (between a subset of participants),
                and that they want you to link your bank account for settling.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will remain online and free as long as it is being used. The source code may be made
                open source if there is interest in that.
            </p>
