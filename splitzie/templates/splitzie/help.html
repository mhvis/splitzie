    <h2>Usage tips</h2>

    <h4>Starting balance</h4>
    <p>
        To enter a starting balance, you can create a payment with an amount of
        0 euros.
        Set the payment as income and enter the starting balances of the
        participants in the division section. Enter negative balances using a
        negative amount.
    </p>
    <h4>Custom repayment</h4>
    <p>
        The repayment form lets you enter arbitrary repayments.
        Say you owe 2 euros to Bob and 3 euros to Alice.
        Instead of repaying both of them, you could also give 5 euros to Bob and ask him to pay the remainder forward.
        On this website you can enter this as a repayment of 5 euros to Bob.
        The balances will then change to reflect that Bob now owes 3 euros to Alice.

    <h4>About rounding</h4>
    <p>
        When a payment is divided, the division amounts may need to be rounded.
        This means that some participants may get assigned an amount that is one cent
        higher than other participants, to make sure that the sum of all divisions
        is exactly equal to the total expense amount.
        The participants who pay this extra cent are chosen randomly.
        The difference is always at most one cent.

    <p>
        For nerds: it is possible to view the exact division script that is used,
        by opening the page source code.

        Also if would like to have a new feature added, let me know.

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone who has the link of a group, can edit it.
        So, if a link is compromised, a malicious user could enter new payments.
        However, it is not possible to delete entered payments,
        therefore no real harm can be done.
        If your link is compromised, you can create a new group and set the starting balances
        as required.
    </p>
    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not use tracking and session cookies,
        nor do we have an account system or log IP address.
        We can see the payments that you entered and the e-mail addresses that you linked
        (this is unavoidable).
        We take great care to ensure that they are well protected.
    </p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        This app is a hobby project, created because I was annoyed that the
        widely used apps WieBetaaltWat and Groepie (Tikkie) do not allow you to do
        partial settlements and that they push their payment system very prominently.
    </p>
    <p>
        This app will remain online and free as long as it is actively used. The source code may be available
        upon request and might be made open source in the future.
