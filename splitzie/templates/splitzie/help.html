                    To enter a starting balance, create a payment with amount 0 and type income.
                    Enter the starting balances in the division fields,
                    with negative balances as a negative value.

                    Entering a payment in this way will modify the balances exactly
                    as inputted in the division fields.

                    The repayment form on the Settle page lets you enter arbitrary repayments.
                    For example, if you owe 2 euros to Bob and 3 euros to Alice,
                    instead of repaying both of them, you could also give 5
                    euros to Bob and ask him to pay the remainder forward.

                    Enter the 5 euros repayment into the form, and the balances will change
                    so that Bob now owes 3 euros to Alice.

                    When a payment is divided, the division amounts may need to be rounded.
                    This means that some participants will get assigned an amount that is one cent
                    higher than other participants, to make sure that the sum of all divisions
                    is exactly equal to the total expense amount.
                    The participants who pay this extra cent are chosen randomly.
                    The difference is always at most one cent.

                    This app is a hobby project, created because I was annoyed that the
                    widely used Dutch apps WieBetaaltWat and Groepie do not allow for
                    partial settlements (between a subset of participants),
                    and that they want you to link your bank account for settling.
